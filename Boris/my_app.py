Based on those evaluations, two corresponding risk scores will be calculated and associated investment portfolios will be chosen from our ETFs offering. Their performance will be assessed and compared to the Benchmark portfolio of 40% Bonds 60% Stock. To increase clients' awareness of our new Crypto mix ETF, we will include the comparison performance of this fund too."

Each fund is constructed with the risk profile of an investor in mind. Our funds are non-diversified and may experience greater volatility than more diversified investments. To compensate for the limited diversification, we only offer Large Cap US equities and Domestic stocks and bonds to reduce volatility brought by small- and medium-cap equities and excluding foreign currency exposure. And yet, there will always be risks involved with ETFs' investments, resulting in the possible loss of money")
